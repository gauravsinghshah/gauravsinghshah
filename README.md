# HI , I AM **GAURAV SINGH**

## 📌 About
- 3rd Year B.Tech Computer Science student focused on building strong fundamentals rather than collecting tools or certificates.
- Spend most of my time writing code, breaking systems, and rebuilding them from scratch.
- Actively developing depth in software engineering, full-stack development, and problem solving.
- Aim to become an industry-ready developer by consistently shipping real projects and mastering core concepts instead of shortcuts.
- Hold myself accountable through measurable progress and continuous improvement.
- Prioritize depth over hype, execution over excuses, and long-term skill growth over short-term validation.
- Seek to contribute to teams that value clarity, ownership, and engineering rigor while continuously pushing my technical and personal limits.
